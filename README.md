**Submission format:** .ipynb file with solution

In this homework you will try to recognize a Russian number plate. You can use any method for symbol recognition (CNN, some classic algorithm or Tesseract). But you are not allowed to use Tesseract for full number plate recognition, only symbol recognition! The main concept is:


1. Undistort the plate (you will have 4 corner points of the plate)
2. Perform segmentation by yourself
3. Recognize symbols
4. Concatenate recognized symbols
